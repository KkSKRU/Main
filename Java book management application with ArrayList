/*
Develop a simple book management application with ArrayList.
User should be able to add a book to ArrayList.
User should be able to remove a book from ArrayList.

Easy: Work with String in ArrayList. All the actions should be available for user.

Medium: Work with String User should be able to repeat all the actions infinitely.

Hard: Create a Book class and work with Book object to the ArrayList.
